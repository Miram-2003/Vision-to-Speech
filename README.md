###Image Captioning App

##Overview

This project is an application that captures an image using a pre-trained image captioning model. The app is built using Streamlit, a popular open-source app framework for Machine Learning and Data Science projects.

###Features
Upload an image and get a caption describing the image.
Easy-to-use web interface powered by Streamlit.

###Files and Directories
app.py: The main application file. Contains the code to run the Streamlit app. requirements.txt: A file listing the required Python packages to run the app.

features.pkl: A serialized file containing features used by the model for image captioning.

###Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed on your system:
Python 3.6 or higher
Streamlit

Installation
Clone the repository
    “git clone https://github.com/RookieAdventurer/Vision-to-Speech”

    “cd image-captioning-app”
   
   This will create a local copy of the project on your machine and navigate into the project directory.

Create a virtual environment and activate it
    “python -m venv venv”

   “source venv/bin/activate”  

 On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate

This step ensures that you create an isolated environment for the project dependencies, preventing conflicts with other projects.


Install the required packages:
   “ pip install -r requirements.txt”
   This command will install all the dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.


Running the App Locally
Run the Streamlite app:

    “streamlit run app.py”
    
   This command starts the Streamlit server and runs the application.

Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8501 to view the app.
 The app will be accessible at this address. You can now interact with the app by  uploading images and getting captions.

Usage
open the app in your browser
Upload an image using the file uploader
The app will display a caption for the uploaded image.
   Simply follow these steps to use the application effectively.
